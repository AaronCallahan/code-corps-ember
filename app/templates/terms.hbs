    <h3>Fundraising with code corps or with third-party organizations through code corps</h3>
    <p>Code Corps facilitates fundraising for projects and acts as a communication platform between Users. When a User posts a project on the Website (“Creator”), they’re inviting other Users to form an Agreement with them. Any User who funds projects or works for projects available on the Website are entering into a transaction and contract with the Creator, not Code Corps.</p>
    <p>Anyone can use the Website to fund projects on a one-time or a reoccurring basis. Once approved by us, organizations can solicit money through fundraising campaigns made available on the Website. Project funding made through the Website are processed through Stripe and are delivered to your selected organization, project or non-profit at least once per quarter (often times more frequently). The Service works with Stripe internationally to ensure that all project funding goes directly to your organization, project or non-profit automatically – and in real-time. Code Corps charges a flat fee of 5% on all payments collected through the Website.</p>
    <p>In addition to Code Corps’s 5% fee, Users also agree to Stripe’s fund transfer fee of 2.9% + 30¢ per successful card charge. Note that Code Corps is not the same company as Stripe and their fees and commissions are subject to change without notice from us. (Before using or accessing the payment company websites, please make sure to read their terms and conditions, which may be found using the link provided here.)</p>
    <p>All fees are deducted from each transaction automatically so you’re never billed for anything.</p>
    <p>You are independently responsible for complying with all applicable laws in all of your actions related to your use of Code Corps’s Services, regardless of the purpose of the use.</p>
    <p>By using Code Corps, Users are representing and warranting that all project funds received are being given and being used solely for the purpose(s) stated within the content of the User’s campaign. We reserve the right to provide information relating to your campaign with project funders of your campaign, and with law enforcement or to assist in any investigation.</p>
    <p><strong>What’s Not Allowed.</strong> Code Corps relies on these Terms and Conditions as a guideline in the decision-making process to arrive at its long-standing right to remove any fund raising campaign at any time for any reason. Code Corps will continue to reserve the right to amend its terms as it deems necessary to support the wide and varied use/cases it encounters on its growing platform. No single set of terms will ever encompass every possible variable and Code Corps will always review questionable campaigns on a case-by-case basis, especially as additional information about campaigns becomes available. Finally, Code Corps regularly considers information from law enforcement and government agencies to help determine what actions our team will take regarding questionable campaigns.</p>

    <p>Code Corps and its affiliates will not interfere arbitrarily, but we reserve the right to cancel or not process fund raising payments because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when an organization, project or non-profit is no longer in existence or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that such fund raising or payments may be fraudulent.
